## Introduction

This project aims to provide a transparent and detailed view of Mali's 2022 budget. By examining the allocation of funds to different state departments and institutions, we gain insights into the government's fiscal priorities and strategies.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: I have downloaded the budget for year 2022 on the state department of finances' site.
- **Data Analysis**: I used Python and Pandas for this project and the libraries Numpy, PILLOW, csv.
- **Visualization and Video Creation**: After analysing the data and getting all the relevant information, I have created single images of the state department and ranked them by expenditurel I have then created a video by adding these images together showing for 2 seconds.
